I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** and **Web3 enthusiast** with a focus on building products that blend clean design and smooth user experience.

Currently, I’m working on [**agenda.fun**](/) — experimenting with ways to make planning and collaboration more intuitive. I enjoy taking ideas from **0 → 1**, diving deep into backend architecture to create things people actually want to use.  

Beyond tech, I’m drawn to any form of **art** — from music and novels to manga and anime. These influences shape my perspective on design, storytelling, and how people connect with products.
