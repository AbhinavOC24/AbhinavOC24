I’m a Full-Stack Developer and Web3 builder with an interest in creating social consumer apps with simple design and smooth user flows.

Right now I’m working on agenda.fun, exploring better ways to handle planning and collaboration. I also enjoy building at hackathons.

I like pulling ideas and inspiration from art, music, manga, and anime—they influence how I approach design and product decisions.
